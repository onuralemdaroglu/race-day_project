<br>
<h1>Race Day</h1>
Codecademy’s annual race is just around the corner! <br><br>
This year, we have a lot of participants. You have been hired to write a program that will register runners for the race and give them instructions on race day.<br>
<br>
Here’s how our registration works.<br><br> There are adult runners (over 18 years of age) and youth runners (under 18 years of age).<br><br>They can register early or late.<br><br>Runners are assigned a race number and start time based on their age and registration.<br>
<br>
<b>Race number:</b><br>
<br>
Early adults receive a race number at or above 1000.<br><br>
All others receive a number below 1000.<br><br>
<strong>Start time:</strong><br><br>

Adult registrants run at 9:30 am or 11:00 am.<br><br>
Early adults run at 9:30 am.<br><br>
Late adults run at 11:00 am.<br><br>
Youth registrants run at 12:30 pm (regardless of registration).<br><br>
But we didn’t plan for runners that are exactly 18! We’ll handle that by the end of the project.
